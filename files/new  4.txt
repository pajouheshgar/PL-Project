That' s right . That' s right . That' s right . Although getting a whole museum is super- cool , is super- cool , you want to know what the greatest honor you' ve given me is ? Do you really want to know ? Really ? I' il tell you . The greatest honor you' ve given me is letting me serve you , the helpless people of Metro City . And at the end of every day , well , I often ask myself â€¦ who would I be without you ? â€“ I love you , Metro Man ! â€“ And I love you , random citizen . I tell you , Minion .
There' s no place like evil lair . I' ve kept it cold and damp just for you , sir . How do I look , Minion ? Do I look bad ? Disgustingly horrifying , sir . You always know what to say . Oh , the brain- bots certainly missed you , sir . Did you miss your daddy ? Who' s a menacing little cyborg ? You are .
Yes , you are . No biting . No , no , no , no , no , no . You want the wrench ? Go get the wrench . â€“ Oh , look at that . â€“ Now , back to laughing . She' s awake . Quick , to work . Miss Ritchi , we meet again . Would it kill you to wash the bag ? You can scream all you wish , Miss Ritchi .
