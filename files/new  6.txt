Boo ! Should' ve known you' d try to crash the party . Oh , I intend to do more than crash it . This is a day you and Metrocity shall not soon forget . It' s pronounced Metro City ! Potato- tomato , potato- tomato . We all know how this ends : with you behind bars . I' m shaking in my custom baby seal leather boots . You will leave Metrocity , or this will be the last you ever hear of Roxanne Ritchi . Roxanne !
Don' t panic , Roxie . â€“ I' m on my way . â€“ Yeah , I' m not panicking . In order to stop me , you need to find me first , Metro Man . We' re at the abandoned observatory . No , we' re not ! Don' t listen to her . She' s crazy . Metro Man approaching , sir . Hold on a second . Oh , good heavens ! You didn' t think you were in the real observatory , did you ?
Ready the death ray , Minion . Death ray , readying . Over here , old friend . In case you haven' t noticed , you' ve fallen right into my trap . You can' t trap justice . It' s an idea , a belief . Even the most heartfelt belief can be corroded over time . Justice is a non- corrosive metal . But metals can be melted by the heat of revange . It' s â€œ revenge , â€ and it' s best served cold .
But it can be easily reheated in the microwave of evil . Well , I think your warranty is about to expire . Maybe I got an extended warranty . Warranties are invalid if you don' t use the product for its intended purpose . Oh , girls , girls , you' re both pretty . Can I go home now ? Of course . That is , if Metro Man can withstand the full , concentrated power of the sun ! Fire ! Minion .
Fire ? â€“ It' s still warming up , sir . â€“ Come again ? â€“ Warming up , sir . â€“ Warming up ? The sun is warming up ? One second more and â€¦ just tippy- tappy tippy- tap- tap , tip- top more , and we are ready in just â€¦ â€“ Honestly ! On my way , Roxie . I told you to have things ready . I told you countless times . Why do you always blame me ? My spider bite is acting up . Your plan is failing . Just admit it .
