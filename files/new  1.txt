But I had something far , far greater . My amazing intellect â€¦ and knack for building objects of mayhem . After a few years , and with some time off for good behavior , I was given an opportunity to better myself through learning â€¦ at a strange place called shool . It was there that I once again ran into Mr Goody Two- Shoes . He had already amassed a gigantic army of soft- headed groupies . He bought their affections with showmanship and extravagant gifts of deliciousness . So I , too , will make this popp- ed corn and win over those mindless drones . Lights out . That' s when I learned a very hard lesson :
Good receives all the praise and adulation , while evil is sent to quiet- time in the corner . So fitting in wasn' t really an option . While they were learning the Itsy Bitsy Spider â€¦ I learned how to dehydrate animate objects and rehydrate them at will . Some days , it felt like it was just me and Minion against the world . No matter how hard I tried , I was always the odd man out , the last one picked , the screw- up , the black sheep â€¦ Get him ! â€¦ the bad boy . â€“ Freak ! Was this my destiny ? Wait , maybe it was .
Being bad is the one thing I' m good at . Then it hit me : If I was the bad boy , then I was going to be the baddest boy of them all . I was destined to be a super- villain , and we were destined to be rivals . The die had been cast , and so began an enduring , epic , lifelong career . And I loved it . Our battles quickly got more elaborate . He would win some . I would almost win others . He took the name Metro Man , defender of Metrocity .
